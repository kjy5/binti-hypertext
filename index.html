            A hypertext document is a type of electronic document that contains hyperlinks, which are clickable links
            that can take you to other parts of the document, or to other documents altogether. This allows for a
            non-linear way of reading and navigating through information, making it easier to access and connect related
            content. The World Wide Web is perhaps the most famous example of a hypertext document system, where web
            pages are linked together through hyperlinks.

            Binti from the Himba tribe in Namibia, who is the first of her people to be accepted into a prestigious
            intergalactic university. The novella explores themes of identity, culture, and tradition, as well as the
            challenges and rewards of pursuing knowledge and breaking down barriers between different worlds and ways of
            life.

            Children often express themselves with no filter. I am Asian American, and less than 2% of the people in
            Duluth, Minnesota looked like me and enjoyed and same foods as me. So, when I brought my lunch to school, my
            classmates initially gawked at what I had and turned away in disgust. To them, traditional delicacies such
            as <a href="#/eggs">咸鸭蛋 (salted duck egg)</a> or <a href="#/noodles">炸酱面 (noodles in fermented bean
            sauce)</a> looked like rotten eggs and spaghetti so old that it turned black. We were all children then, and
            children learn fast. I soon became their friend, and I was able to share my culture with them.

        <p>
            A salted duck egg is a preserved duck egg that has been soaked in a brine solution containing salt and other
            ingredients such as charcoal and tea leaves. The resulting egg yolk is typically salty and savory, with a
            unique texture and flavor. It is a popular ingredient in various Asian cuisines, used in dishes such as
            mooncakes, steamed buns, and congee.

            A hypertext document is a type of electronic document that contains hyperlinks, which are clickable links
            that can take you to other parts of the document, or to other documents altogether. This allows for a
            non-linear way of reading and navigating through information, making it easier to access and connect related
            content. The World Wide Web is perhaps the most famous example of a hypertext document system, where web
            pages are linked together through hyperlinks.
